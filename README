SugarCaneMC

SugarCaneMC performs MonteCarlo simulation of a sugarcane farm in Minecraft wuth the common desing. 

Minecraft mechanics

Sugar canes are plant that grow by one block when the top block has recieved 16 random tick, until they reach an height of three block. When a sugar cane is broken, the number of random ticks recieved is resetted. Typical automatic sugar canes farm relies on the interaction with piston and Observer

The typical structure is as follow:

Redstone delays:
Due to differences in Java(J) and Bedrock(BR), the delays are different, here we try to  gives an exstensive explanation:

Once the sugarcare grows in front of the observer, the observer emits 1 redstone-tick later (2 in BR) a redstone signal of level 15 for 2 redstone ticks. Assuming that it is powering a redstone line, it can power 14 piston either side plus one below itself for a total of 29 pistons. Once a piston is activated, it extend after 1 redstone tick (BR) or 1 game tick (J). It retracts one redstone tick after it is unpowered. While the piston is extended, the sugarcane cannot grow even if it gets a random tick. 


# tick structure 
  At each game tick, the game proceed as follow (only relevant mechanics):
   - scheduled block tick are executed. It means that triggered observed activates, triggered piston extend/retract
   - random tick.
